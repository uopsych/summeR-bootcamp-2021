# summeR-bootcamp-2021

This website contains materials for a 3-day introductory R workshop for the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.uoregon.edu/) at the University of Oregon. 

The full website is available here: https://uopsych-r-bootcamp-2020.netlify.app/

# Description

The bootcamp gives a gentle introduction to R and RStudio, transforming and visualizing data with the tidyverse, and the basics of R Markdown. It assumes no prior experience with R or any other programming language and is designed to get learners up and running with the most widely useful tools for reproducible data analysis in R while emphasizing best practices for writing code and organizing project-oriented workflows. 

It also contains a curated list of resources for each topic for those who want more opportunities for further learning and practice. The materials have been designed such that you should be able to work through the slides and exercises at your own pace if you were not able to attend the bootcamp sessions.

I also adapted content from a variety of other sources, including [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), [Modern Dive](https://moderndive.com/), [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/)'s [R Markdown for Medicine](https://rmd4medicine.netlify.app/) workshop, [Michael Frank](https://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/)'s [R Markdown workshop](https://github.com/mcfrank/rmarkdown-workshop), and [Sylvia Canelón](https://silvia.rbind.io/)'s Intro to the Tidyverse [presentation](https://github.com/spcanelon/2020-rladies-chi-tidyverse) for R-Ladies Chicago. 

This website was based on a template [demo course website](https://github.com/apreshill/share-blogdown) created by [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io) as part of an [RStudio Webinar](https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/sharing-on-short-notice-how-to-get-your-materials-online-with-r-markdown/) along with [Desirée De Leon](https://desiree.rbind.io/). All artwork, unless otherwise noted, is by [Allison Horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst). Note boxes were created following a [tutorial](https://desiree.rbind.io/post/2019/making-tip-boxes-with-bookdown-and-rmarkdown/) by [Desirée De Leon](https://desiree.rbind.io/). I also borrowed some [custom CSS](https://github.com/emitanaka/ninja-theme) from [Emi Tanaka](https://emitanaka.org/). 

Slides were created using [`{xaringan}`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/) and [`{xaringanExtra}`](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/#/) by [Garrick Aden-Buie](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/). I also used [`{flipbookr}`](https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/about) by [Gina Reynolds](https://evangelinereynolds.netlify.app/) for making ggplot flipbooks and [`{flair}`](https://r-for-educators.github.io/flair/index.html) by [Kelly Bodwin](https://www.kelly-bodwin.com/) for color-coding.

The code of conduct for this bootcamp was adapted from [Cascadia R Conf](https://cascadiarconf.com/policies/).
