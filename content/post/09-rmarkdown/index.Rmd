R Markdown is one of the most powerful tools at your disposal as a scientist -- particularly for communicating and sharing your work. For example, this entire website and all of the slides were created using R Markdown! Today we'll take a little deeper of a dive into what R Markdown is than what we covered in our initial introduction to R, and you will hopefully get a sense of the endless possibilities it affords you.
