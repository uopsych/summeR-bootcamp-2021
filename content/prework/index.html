<p>Hello! Welcome to the 4th Annual UO Psych R Bootcamp. There are a few things we’d like you to do before we get started to make things run as smoothly as possible.</p>
<div class="clock">
<p>If possible, please try to complete this checklist <em>before</em> the first bootcamp session. Thank you!</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p><br></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Make sure you have a <a href="https://service.uoregon.edu/TDClient/2030/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=101392">Zoom account</a> set up through University of Oregon. We will use the same Zoom link for each day of the bootcamp, and you will receive the link via email and slack.</p></li>
<li><p>Join the <a href="https://uodatascience.slack.com/">Slack workspace</a>. This how we will primarily be communicating with each other, and it is the best place to ask questions outside of bootcamp hours. We’ll be using the channel <code>#bootcamp2021</code>. You should have received an email invitation to join the <code>SlackRs</code> workspace (check your Junk/Spam inbox) – if you haven’t received an invitation, send Brendan an email at <a href="mailto:bcullen@uoregon.edu">bcullen@uoregon.edu</a>. When you join, please introduce yourself and say hello in the <code>#bootcamp2021</code> channel!</p></li>
<li><p>Join the <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/169455/join?access_code=yWOd%2Fuf8lAnvG%2Bz1KkK38lol4iUfCMrw60kxkTq2">RStudio Cloud workspace</a>. When you click this link you will be prompted to create a free RStudio Cloud account. Follow the instructions and click “Join space” when prompted. You should find yourself inside a workspace called <strong>UO Psych Bootcamp 2021</strong>. Please don’t open any of the materials just yet – we’ll go through these together during the bootcamp.</p></li>
<li><p>Review the <a href="/#code_of_conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Optional</em> - Download <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a> if you don’t have it already. The materials on this website are best viewed with Chrome. We’ve found that using other browsers (Firefox, Safari, etc.) can lead to some technical difficulties.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you all soon. Hopefully we’ll have you loving R in no time!</p>
<p>-Brendan</p>
