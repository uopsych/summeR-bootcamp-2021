Data visualization is at the very core of science. In order to understand and glean insights from our data, we need different ways of representing it visually. R has an incredible capacity for creating all sorts of plots, charts, and tables, and today we will only scratch the surface. We will discuss the fundamentals of the powerful ggplot2 package and the "grammar of graphics" that underlies it.
