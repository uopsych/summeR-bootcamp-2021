# Functions & Debugging

---
# Functions

Data (and objects more generally) are one of the building blocks of R. The other is **functions**. 

--

We've already used a handful of functions, including `seq()`, arithmetic functions (`+`, `*`, etc.), `c()`, `list()`, `data.frame()`, `str()`, etc.

--
***

Functions take some form of an input, perform some operation, and then return some object(s) as output.

--

Functions are made up of **arguments**.

---
# Functions

Let's take another look at the help documentation for `seq()`... `r icon::fa("cloud")`
 
```{r eval=FALSE}
?seq
```

--
***

You can see it has the arguments `from`, `to`, `by`, `length.out`, and `along.with`.

--

You might also notice that each of the arguments have a value after the `=` in the documentation. 

--

These values are the **defaults**; they are what the arguments will be set to if you don't specify them. 

--
***

In fact, since all of the arguments have defaults, we don't have to specify any to run `seq()` as we saw earlier.

```{r}
seq()
```

---
# Functions

Let's take a look at a new function, `mean()`... `r icon::fa("cloud")`

```{r eval=FALSE}
?mean
```


---
# Functions

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/help_page_annotated.png")
```

# Functions

What happens if we run `mean()` without any arguments?

```{r error=TRUE}
mean()
```

--
***

We get an error telling us that the argument `"x"` is missing and has no default. 

--

Whenever you see this error, it means you are missing a required argument (i.e., an argument without a default). 

--

If we look at the help documentation, you can see `x` is the data from which to calculate a mean.

---
# Functions

Let's create some data to calculate the mean of. 

```{r}
vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2, 4)
```

--

Now let's take the mean of `vec`.

```{r}
mean(x = vec)
```

--
***

Note that `mean()` has two more optional arguments listed: 

+ `trim`, which returns a trimmed mean

+ `na.rm`, which takes a logical value indicating if it should remove missing values or not before it calculates the mean (`FALSE` by default). 

---
# Functions

What happens if we don't remove `NA`s before calculating the mean? Let's check it out...

--

```{r}
vec_na <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, NA, 2, 4)
```

--

```{r}
mean(vec_na)
```

--
***

It returns `NA`. NAs are contagious! A single `NA` in a vector will cause many functions to return `NA` (unless they remove them by default). 

--

This sort of makes sense - the mean of `vec_na` in its entirety is unknown, since we don't know what the `NA` value is. That's why you have to remove `NA`'s before running calculations by setting `na.rm = TRUE`

--

```{r}
mean(vec_na, na.rm = TRUE)
```

# Your turn `r (yt_counter <- yt_counter + 1)`

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 2)
```

1. Look up the help documentation for the function `sd()` (type directly in the RStudio console)

1. Calculate the standard deviation of `vec_na`. Be sure to remove missing values first. 

```{r}
vec_na <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, NA, 2, 4)
```

---
class: solution

# Solution

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Q1]

```{r eval=FALSE}
?sd
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Q2]

```{r}
sd(vec_na, na.rm = TRUE)
```

]
]

---
# Functions

You can get the length of many objects with `length()`

```{r}
length(vec_na)
```

--
***

`nrow()` and `ncol()` can be used to get the number of rows or columns in a matrix or data frame. Let's look at the data frame `df` below

```{r echo=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(a = c(1, 2),
                 b = c(3, 4),
                 c = c(5, 6),
                 d = c(7, 8))

df
```

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[nrow]

```{r}
nrow(df)
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[ncol]

```{r}
ncol(df)
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[length]

The length of a data frame is the same as the number of columns. 

```{r}
length(df)
```

]
]

---
# Functions

Take another look at the help documentation for `sd()` `r emo::ji("eyes")`. 

Notice that there are two arguments and they are in order, `x` followed by `na.rm = FALSE`. 

--
***

You can set arguments explicitly by *name*

```{r}
sd(x = vec_na, na.rm = TRUE)
```

--
***

You can also set them *positionally* and drop the argument names

```{r}
sd(vec_na, TRUE)
```

---
# Functions

When using arguments positionally (without their names), **make sure the arguments are in the right order.** 

--

Otherwise you can end up with weird errors or warnings. 

```{r error=TRUE}
sd(TRUE, vec_na)
```

--
***

However, if you explicitly name the arguments, you can actually put them in a different order. This isn't recommended unless there is a good reason though...

```{r}
sd(na.rm = TRUE, x = vec_na)
```

---
# Packages

So far, we've been working with functions that are already installed and loaded when we open R.

--

However, many of the functions we want to use are not part of the basic R install. They come in **packages** that other R users create and share.

--

Most packages can be accessed from [**CRAN**](https://cran.r-project.org/) - the Comprehensive R Archive Network. 

---
# Packages

The most common way to get a package is to download it from CRAN using `install.packages("package_name")` -- notice the quotes.

--
***

For example, one package we're going to use tomorrow is rio, which has really easy functions for importing and exporting data. 

If we wanted to install the rio package, we would use 

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rio")
```

--
***

A couple notes here. 

1) You will sometimes see package names written inside `{}`, e.g. `{rio}`. 

--

2) To make things easier in our online format, I have pre-installed all the packages we will be needing on RStudio Cloud. 

--

However, in order to access the functions from these packages, we still need to *load* them...

---
# Packages 

Installing a package puts a copy of it into our personal library that R has access to. In general, we only need to install a package once.

--
***

However, whenever we want to to use a package, we need to load the package in our working session in RStudio. 

We load packages with the `library()` function -- we do this once *per session*.

--
***

Loading a package basically makes the contents of that package searchable by R. 

In other words, after loading a package, R is able to find the functions included in that package. 

You can see what functions are available in your workspace by running the `search()` function

---
class: inverse
# Your turn `r (yt_counter <- yt_counter + 1)`

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 3)
```

1. In your RStudio console, look up the help documentation for`import()` by typing `?import`. What do you see?

1. Run `search()` in the console. Is the rio package included in this list?
 
1. Again in the console, load the rio package using the `library()` function. 

1. Now look again at the help documentation for `import()`. What do you see this time?

1. Run `search()` again. What is different this time?

# Packages

Another package we're going to use a lot going forward is **tidyverse.** 

tidyverse is actually a "meta-package", meaning it contains many individual packages inside of it that are all bundled together. 

--
***

When we load tidyverse we get quite a bit of info. 

<br>
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidyverse_package_load.png")
```

---
# Packages

Conflicts occur when the same name is used for different things. 

--

For example, the dplyr package and the stats package (preloaded) both have a function called `filter()`. 

--

When we call `filter()`, R will only call one of those functions and it might not be the one we want. 

--
***

Which one will R choose? R has an order in which it searches...

--

It starts with the Global Environment, then searches packages in the order that they were loaded, searching more recently loaded packages first.

--
***

You can tell R explicitly that you want a function from a particular package using the notation `package::function_name`. When in doubt, it's better to use the double colon operator to be specific about which function you want.

# Your turn `r (yt_counter <- yt_counter + 1)`

# Debugging

Before we wrap up, let's talk about error messages.

--

You will run into them constantly, even when using functions you've used many times before -- and especially when using functions/packages that are new to you.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/error.jpg")
```

# Debugging

We're not going to go into details of debugging, because that could (and should) be a whole course on its own. 

But there are a few general things to be aware of...
