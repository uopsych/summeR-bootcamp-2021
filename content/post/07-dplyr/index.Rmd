Almost always when you are given data to analyze, it will not be in a format in which you are immediately able to create visualizations, perform modelling, generate tables etc. In other words, it needs to be wrangled into the right format. The dplyr package has a very powerful set of functions for just this, and today we will be covering the core dplyr "verbs" that allow you to transform your data with optimal specificity and efficiency.
