# Your Turn 1 

1. Look up the help documentation for the function `sd()` (type directly in the RStudio console)


2. Calculate the standard deviation of `vec_na`. Be sure to remove missing values first. 

```{r}
#Q2. 

vec_na <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, NA, 2, 4)

```



# Your Turn 2

1. In your RStudio console, look up the help documentation for`import()` by typing `?import`. What do you see?

2. Run `search()` in the console. Is the rio package included in this list?
 
3. Again in the console, load the rio package using the `library()` function. 

4. Now look again at the help documentation for `import()`. What do you see this time?

5. Run `search()` again. What is different this time?



# Your Turn 3

1. Look up for the help documentation for `filter()` from the `stats` package.

2. Now look up the help documentation for `filter()` from the dplyr package.
